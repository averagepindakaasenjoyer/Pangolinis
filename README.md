- **Data Analytics/**: Notebooks for exploring and visualizing the dataset. Also contains a script with an updated evaluate function for the model.
- **Model Architecture/**: Initial modeling approaches, including a simple CNN for structured data.
- **Model Pipeline/**
  - `pipelineClass.py`: Main class handling the model pipeline.
  - `pipeline_doc_example.py`: Example of pipeline usage.
  - `pipeline_notebook.ipynb`: Interactive version of the pipeline.
- **Preprocessing/**: Scripts for standardization and data cleaning.
  - `Preprocessing.ipynb`: Exploratory preprocessing notebook.
  - `preprocessing_pipeline.ipynb`: Full pipeline-ready preprocessing.
  - `Standardize.ipynb`: Data standardization procedures.
